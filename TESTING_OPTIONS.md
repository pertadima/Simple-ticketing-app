# Laravel Testing with Code Coverage - Solutions

## Current Status
✅ PHP is working cleanly without warnings
❌ No coverage driver installed yet

## Option 1: Use Docker (Recommended)
This is the most reliable method since it provides a clean environment:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage using Docker
./test-with-docker.sh
```

## Option 2: Install Homebrew PHP with Xdebug
```bash
# Install Homebrew PHP
brew install php

# Install Xdebug
brew install xdebug

# Use Homebrew PHP for testing
/opt/homebrew/bin/php vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/html
```

## Option 3: Run Tests Without Coverage (Current Working Option)
```bash
# Basic tests without coverage
./vendor/bin/phpunit

# Specific test file
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/AuthControllerTest.php

# With detailed output
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/AuthControllerTest.php --testdox
```

## Option 4: Use Laravel Sail (If you want Docker integration)
```bash
# Install Sail
composer require laravel/sail --dev

# Publish Sail
php artisan sail:install

# Run tests with Sail
./vendor/bin/sail test --coverage
```

## Quick Test Commands

### Run all tests:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Run specific test class:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/AuthControllerTest.php
```

### Run specific test method:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/AuthControllerTest.php --filter test_login_with_valid_credentials
```

### Run tests with detailed output:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **First**: Run tests without coverage to ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/AuthControllerTest.php --testdox
   ```

2. **Then**: Choose one of the coverage options above based on your preference:
   - Docker (most reliable)
   - Homebrew PHP (local installation)
   - Laravel Sail (if you want Docker integration with Laravel)

3. **Finally**: Set up continuous integration with coverage reporting if needed.

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail with 404 errors, it means the routes don't match. Check:
- Routes are defined in `routes/api.php`
- Middleware is properly configured
- Database is migrated for testing
